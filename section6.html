Actually, if you think about it, I don't think I would be an actress if Beetlejuice (1988) hadn't come along, because I really wasn't thriving in those auditions.

        <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/quotes/?ref_=nm_dyk_qu">
            For a long time, I was almost ashamed of being an actress. I felt like it was a shallow occupation. People would be watching my every move.
