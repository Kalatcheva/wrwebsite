       <h2>Biografy: </h2>
       
       <p> Winona Laura Horowitz was born on October 29, 1971  in Winona County, Minnesota. She is the daughter of Cynthia, an author and video producer, and Michael Horowitz, a publisher and bookseller. She grew up in a ranch commune in Northern California which had no electricity.  
           Ryder moved with her parents to Petaluma, California when she was ten and enrolled in acting classes. At age 13, she had a video audition to the film Desert Bloom (1986), but did not get the role. However, director David Seltzer spotted her and cast her in Lucas (1986). When telephoned to ask how she would like to have her name appear on the credits, she suggested Ryder as her father's Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels album was playing the background. Ryder was selected for the role of Mary Corleone in The Godfather Part III (1990), but had to drop out of the role after catching the flu from the strain of doing the films Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990) and Mermaids (1990). She later made The Age of Innocence (1993), which was directed by Martin Scorsese, whom she believes to be "the best director in the world".
