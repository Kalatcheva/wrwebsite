        <h2>Trivia:</h2>

        <ul> 
            <li> She suffers from insomnia. She allegedly has had a habit of talking on the phone with actor Al Pacino, who also suffers from insomnia.</li>
            <li> Her agent begged her not to do the comedy Heathers (1988), saying her career would be over. </li>
            <li> Wanted to be a competitive skateboarder when she was younger. </li>
            <li> She owns some of Hollywood's stars' most priceless possessions (Louis Armstrong's bongo drums among others). She also has a collection of vintage Hollywood costumes, including Russ Tamblyn's jacket from West Side Story (1961), Leslie Caron's dress from An American in Paris (1951), Claudette Colbert's gown from It Happened One Night (1934), Olivia de Havilland's blouse from Gone with the Wind (1939), and Sandra Dee's bikini from the "Tammy movies". </li>
            <li> Suffers from aquaphobia because of trauma she suffered at age 12 when she nearly drowned. This caused problems when she had to act in some of the underwater scenes in Alien Resurrection (1997). The scenes had to be reshot numerous times because of this. </li>
            <li> Dropped out of The Godfather Part III (1990). She said in an interview later that year that she arrived in Rome to film and simply could not get out of bed. A doctor was called and ordered her to return home and sleep. </li>
            <li> Had dated Johnny Depp for many years. His original tattoo of her read: "Winona Forever". After they broke up, he had this reduced to "Wino Forever". </li>
            <li> Good friends with Courtney Love and the late Brittany Murphy. </li>
        </ul>
